<a><b>Why was this website created?</b></a>
<br>
<br>
<a>I have been taking Midterm Test week since Monday of this week, and this website was created as a project of Web Programming subject for completing Midterm Test. Actually not just for the Midterm Test/Project, but also as a way for me to learn more about web programming especially about web layout, the aesthetic value of some website and the good content to be added on the website.</a>
<br>
<a>Hopefully, you'd appreciate this website that i've created</a>
<br>
<a>And if you have any cristism or suggestions to improve this website, feel free to contact me</a>
<br>
<a>I have added my private contacts down bellow</a>
<br>
<br>
<a>THANK YOU :)</a>
