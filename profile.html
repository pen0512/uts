<a><b>I will let you know me first</b></a>
<br>
<br>
<a>I am Purwa, I was born in Wonosobo, December 5th 1999, i live in the same place as where I was born and I'm first year of <b>Technical Information</b> (Teknik Informatika) student, under <b>Department of Computer Science</b> (Ilmu Komputer) in <b>Dian Nuswantoro University</b>. I wanted to study Technical Information because I graduated from my Vocational High School and i had been studying <b>Computer and Network Engineering</b> for 3 years there. And I thought I should improve more my knowledge about Computer things, and i do love this. I hope it's the best way that i've choosed. And I've predicted that Technical Information student will be really needed in the future.</p>
